## Goal

While learning how to use Eleventy, I came across [a few starter projects](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/starter/), which are _amazing_, but none of gave me complete package to build out a site quickly.

So, I made this.

## Frameworks Used
- [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/)
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- [Flowbite](https://flowbite.com/)
- [Decap (formerly known as Netlify CMS)](https://decapcms.org/)

2. Install dependencies: `npm i`
3. Start development: `npm run dev`
4. Visit http://localhost:8080 to see your work-in-progress
