## Goal

[Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/) and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) are my favorite things.

While learning how to use Eleventy, I came across [a few starter projects](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/starter/), which are _amazing_, but none of gave me complete package to build out a site quickly.

So, I made this and it seems to work ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
